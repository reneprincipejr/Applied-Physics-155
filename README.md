# Applied-Physics-155
## Computational Methods in Physics I

#### Course Credit: 4.0 units
#### Prerequisite: Math 121.1 (Elementary Differential Equations)

### Description
Number systems and number representations; overview of computer hardware and software; computer programming methods; numerical analysis; research data processing; introduction to
numerical simulation and modeling.

### Objectives
At the end of this course, the student should become aware of what is involved in computational physics; be able to write clear, reliable programs in a timely manner; and use computer graphics to aid in understanding physics problems.

### Course Coverage.
Chapters 1 – 6 and 8 of Computational Physics with Python supplemented by course notes.

Some of the topics that will be discussed in class are:
<br> • Introduction: number systems, machine representation, algorithms
<br> • Graphics and visualization: graphs, scatter plots, density plots
<br> • Accuracy and speed: variables and ranges, numerical error, program speed
<br> • Basic statistical analysis: measures of central tendencies and spread, data storage and retrieval, hypothesis testing
<br> • Integrals and derivatives: fundamental methods for evaluating integrals, errors on integrals, choosing  the number of steps, Romberg integration, Gaussian quadrature, choosing an integration method, derivatives, interpolation
<br> • Solution of linear and nonlinear equations: simultaneous linear equations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, nonlinear equations, maxima and minima of functions
<br> • Ordinary differential equations: first-order differential equations with one variable, differential 
equations with more than one variable, second-order differential equations, varying the step size, boundary value problems
